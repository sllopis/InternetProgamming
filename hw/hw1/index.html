                    An Operating System (OS) is the most important piece of software running in a computer. <br>
                    It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its hardware and <br>
                    software. The OS allows the user to have a direct communication with the computer <br>
                    without having to worry about learning the computer's language. <br>

                    Operating Systems control the hardware and software of your computer without you even realizing. <br>
                    The OS takes care of multiple processes running at once that need the usage of your computer's <br>
                    Central Process Unit (CPU), memory, and storage. It ensures that everything runs smoothly. <br>

                    Operating Systems are built-in software already in your computer when you first buy it. Although most people <br>
                    end up using or upgrading the OS in the machine they first bought, there are still some other people who install <br>
                    a different Operating System from the factory one in their computers. The three most commonly used Operating Systems nowadays are:
