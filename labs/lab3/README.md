WHAT WE ARE MISSING:

1) SESSIONS: 
	- We need to insert sessions for the elapsed time feature AND
	  to count the number of times a player has won.

2) CSS & HTML:
	- We need to insert a nice layout and a button to refresh everytime!

3) PHP:
	- We need to add the displayWinner() see functions.php file for details.
	- Also randomizePlayers() see functions.php file for details.
	- Maybe we should also adjust the range so it's much closer to 42 than it is right now,
	  since I have seen that the points will go to 50,48..

If you have any questions about my part, let me know, I'll be more than happy to help!
